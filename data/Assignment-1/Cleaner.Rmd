## Assignment 1 Data Cleaner

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Script purpose: clean & report quiz grades
1. Imports grades and keys
2. Combines all grade data into one dataframe
3. Saves grade data in a single table of the following format

### Import & Clean Columns
#### Yearly Course Data
1. Import Course Data
2. Rename columns to make them pretty (and understandable)
3. Extract only the columns we care about

```{r course-grades}
Course17 <- read_csv("AnonCourseGrades1712.csv")

Course17 %>%  # take out Course7 data
  rename(TotalPts = 'Total [Total Pts: up to 500] |1403917',
         TotalPct = 'Running Grade [Total Pts: up to 100] |1447324',
         HW = 'HW [Total Pts: 100] |1447322', 
         Q1 = 'Q1 [Total Pts: 100] |1447316', 
         Q2 = 'Q2 [Total Pts: 100] |1447318',
         Labs = 'Labs [Total Pts: 100] |1447319') %>% #now take this with the renamed things
  select(-'Final [Total Pts: 100] |1447315') %>% #gets rid of Final column
  mutate(TotalPct = parse_number(TotalPct)) -> Course17 # turns percentage -> number

Course18 <- read_csv("AnonCourseGrades1812.csv")
Course18 %>%
  rename(TotalPct = 'WeightedTotal [Total Pts: up to 98.5 Percentage] |1704782',
         TotalPts = 'Total [Total Pts: up to 490 Score] |1704781',
         Quiz1 = 'Quiz1 [Total Pts: 90 Score] |1719589',
         Quiz2 = 'Quiz2 [Total Pts: 100 Score] |1719590',
         Labs = 'LabGrade [Total Pts: 100 Score] |1719591',
         HW = 'Homework [Total Pts: 100 Score] |1719593') %>%
  select(ID,TotalPct,TotalPts,Quiz1,Quiz2,Labs,HW) -> Course18

```

### Exam Data
1. Read in CSV
2. Rename columns
3. Extract Date Data
```{r exam-data}
#1
ExamDf <- read_csv("AnonTestResponses - TestData1709to1812.csv")
Key <- read_csv("TestKey.csv",col_names=F)

#2
ExamDf %>%
  rename(ID = 'What is your 8 digit student id?',
         Section = 'Which lecture section are you in?') -> ExamDf

colnames(ExamDf)[4:ncol(ExamDf)] <- paste0("Q", 1:30)   #Replaces question column names with Q1...Q30

#3
ExamDf %>%
  mutate(Timestamp = mdy_hms(Timestamp),
         Timestamp = date(Timestamp)) -> ExamDf

for (i in 4:ncol(ExamDf)){
  str_sub(as.matrix(ExamDf[,i]),1,1) -> ExamDf[,i] 
}
```
```{r test cell}

```
